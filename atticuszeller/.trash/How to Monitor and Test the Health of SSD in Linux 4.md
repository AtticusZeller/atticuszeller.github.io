# How to Monitor and Test the Health of SSD in Linux

## What is S.M.A.R.T.?

S.M.A.R.T. –for [Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.)— is a technology embedded in storage devices like hard disk drives or SSDs and whose goal is to monitor their health status.

In practice, S.M.A.R.T. will monitor several disk parameters during normal drive operations, like the number of reading errors, the drive startup times or even the environmental condition. Moreover, S.M.A.R.T. and can also perform on-demand tests on the drive.

Ideally, S.M.A.R.T. would allow anticipating __predictable__ failures such as those caused by mechanical wearing or degradation of the disk surface, as well as __unpredictable__ failures caused by an unexpected defect. Since drives usually don’t fail abruptly, S.M.A.R.T. gives an option for the operating system or the system administrator to identify soon-to-fail drives so they can be replaced before any data loss occurs.

## What isn’t S.M.A.R.T.?

All that seems wonderful. However, S.M.A.R.T. is not a crystal ball. It cannot predict with 100% accuracy a failure nor, on the other hand, guarantee a drive will not fail without any early warning. At best, S.M.A.R.T. should be used to __estimate the likeliness__ of a failure.

Given the statistical nature of failure prediction, the S.M.A.R.T. technology particularly interests company using a large number of storage units, and field studies have been conducted to estimate the accuracy of S.M.A.R.T. reported issues to anticipate disk replacement needs in data centers or server farms.

In 2016, [Microsoft and The Pennsylvania State University conducted a study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a7-narayanan.pdf) focussing on SSDs.

According to that study, it appears some S.M.A.R.T. attributes are good indicators of imminent failure. The paper specifically mentions:

Reallocated (Realloc) Sector Count:

While the underlying technology is radically different, that indicator seems as significant in the SSD world than it was in the hard drive world. Worth mentioning because of wear-leveling algorithms used in SSDs, when several blocks start failing, chances are many more will fail soon.Program/Erase (P/E) fail count:

This is a symptom of a problem with the underlying flash hardware where the drive was unable to clear or store data in a block. Because of imperfections in the manufacturing process, few such errors can be anticipated. However, flash memories have a limited number of clear/write cycles. So, once again, a sudden increase in the number of events might indicate the drive has reached its end of life limit, and we can anticipate many more memory cells to fail soon.CRC and Uncorrectable errors (“Data Error”):

These events can be caused either by storage error or issues with the drive’s internal communication link. This indicator takes into account both __corrected__ errors (thus without any issue reported to the host system) as well as __uncorrected__ errors (thus blocks the drive has reported being unable to read to the host system). In other words, __correctable__ errors are invisible to the host operating system, but they nevertheless impact the drive performances since data has to be corrected by the drive firmware, and a possible sector relocation might occur.SATA downshift count:

Because of temporary disturbances, issues with the communication link between the drive and the host, or because of internal drive issues, the SATA interface can switch to a lower signaling rate. Downgrading the link below the nominal link rate has the obvious impact on the observed drive performances. Selecting a lower signaling rate is not uncommon, especially on older drives. So this indicator is most significant when correlated with the presence of one or several of the preceding ones.

According to the study, 62% of the failed SSD showed __at least__ one of the above symptoms. However, if you reverse that statement, that also means 38% of the studied SSDs failed __without__ showing any of the above symptoms. The study did not mention though if the failed drives have exhibited any other S.M.A.R.T. reported failure or not. So this cannot be directly compared to the 36% failure-without-prior-notice mentioned for hard drives in the Google paper.

The Microsoft/Pennsylvania State University paper does not disclose the exact drive models studied, but according to the authors, most of the drives are coming from the same vendor spanning several generations.

The study noticed significant differences in reliability between the different models. For example, the “worst” model studied exhibits a 20% failure rate nine months after the first relocation error and up to 36% failure rate nine months after the first occurrence of data errors. The “worst” model also happens to be the older drive generation studied in the paper.

On the other hand, for the same symptoms, the drives belonging to the youngest generation of devices shows only 3% and 20% respectively failure rate for the same errors. It is hard to tell if those figures can be explained by improvements in the drive design and manufacturing process, or if this is simply an effect of drive aging.

Most interestingly, and I gave some possible reasons earlier, the paper mentions that, rather than the raw value, this is a sudden increase in the number of reported errors that should be considered as an alarming indicator:

“”” There is a higher likelihood of the symptoms preceding SSD failures, with an intense manifestation and rapid progression preventing their survivability beyond a few months “””

____In other words, one occasional S.M.A.R.T. reported error is probably not to be considered as a signal of imminent failure. However, when a healthy SSD starts reporting more and more errors, a short- to mid-term failure has to be anticipated.____

But how to know if your hard drive or SSD is healthy? Either to satisfy your curiosity or because you want to start monitoring your drives closely, it is time now to introduce the `smartctl` monitoring tool:

# Using Smartctl to Monitor Status of Your SSD in Linux

There are [ways to list disks in Linux](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-list-disks/) but to monitor the S.M.A.R.T. status of your disk, I suggest the `smartctl` tool, part of the `smartmontool` package (at least on Debian/Ubuntu).

```
sudo apt install smartmontools
```

`smartctl` is a [command line](https://linuxhandbook.com/category/linux-commands/) tool, but this is perfect, especially if you want to automate data collection, on your servers especially.

The first step when using `smartctl` is to check if your disk has S.M.A.R.T. enabled and is supported by the tool:

```
sh$ sudo smartctl -i /dev/sdb
smartctl 6.6 2016-05-31 r4324 [x86_64-linux-4.9.0-6-amd64] (local build)

As you can see, my laptop internal hard drive indeed has S.M.A.R.T. capabilities, and S.M.A.R.T. support is enabled. So, what now about the S.MA.R.T. status? Are there some errors recorded?

Reporting “all SMART information about the disk” is the job of the `-a` option:

```

## Understanding the Output of Smartctl Command

That is a lot of information and it is not always easy to interpret those data. The most interesting part is probably the one labeled as __“Vendor Specific SMART Attributes with Thresholds”__. It reports various statistics gathered by the S.M.A.R.T. device and let you compare those value (current or all-time worst) with some vendor-defined threshold.

For example, here is how my disk reports relocated sectors:

```
ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE
  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   036    Pre-fail  Always       -       3
```

You can see this a “pre-fail” attribute. That just means that attribute is corresponding to anomalies. So, __if__ that attribute exceeds the threshold, that could be an indicator of imminent failure. The other category is “Old\_age” for attributes corresponding to “normal wearing” attributes.

The last field (here “3”) is corresponding the raw value for that attribute as reported by the drive. Usually, this number has a physical significance. Here, this is the actual number of relocated sectors. However, for other attributes, it could be a temperature in degrees Celsius, a time in hours or minutes, or the number of times the drive has encountered a specific condition.

In addition to the raw value, a S.M.A.R.T. enabled drive must report “normalized” values (fields value, worst and threshold). These values are normalized in the range 1-254 (0-255 for the threshold). The disk firmware performs that normalization using some internal algorithm. Moreover, different manufacturers may normalize the same attribute differently. Most values are reported as a percentage, the higher being the best, but this is not mandatory. When a parameter is lower or equal to the manufacturer supplied threshold, the disk is said to have failed for that attribute. With all the reserves mentioned in the first part of that article, when a “pre-fail” attribute has failed, presumably a disk failure is imminent.

As a second example, let’s examine the “seek error rate”:

```
ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE
  7 Seek_Error_Rate         0x000f   071   060   030    Pre-fail  Always       -       51710773327
```

Actually, and this is a problem with S.M.A.R.T. reporting, the exact meaning of each value is vendor-specific. In my case, Seagate is using a logarithmic scale to normalize the value. So “71” means roughly one error for 10 million seeks (10 to the 7.1st power). Amusingly enough, the all-time worst was one error for 1 million seeks (10 to the 6.0th power). If I interpret that correctly, that means my disk heads are more accurately positioned now than they were in the past. I did not follow that disk closely, so this analysis is subject to caution. Maybe the drive just needed some running-in period when it was initially commissioned? Unless this is a consequence of mechanical parts wearing, and thus opposing less friction today? In any case, and whatever the reason is, this value is more a performance indicator than a failure early warning. So that does not bother me a lot.

Besides that, and three suspects errors recorded about six months ago, that drive appears in surprisingly good conditions (according to S.M.A.R.T.) for a stock laptop drive that was powered on for more than 1100 days (26423 hours):

```

Out of curiosity, I ran the same test on a much more recent laptop equipped with an SSD:

This is typically the output you can expect for a brand new SSD. Even if, because of the lack of normalization or metainformation for vendor-specific data, many attributes are reported as “Unknown\_SSD\_Attribute.” I may only hope future versions of `smartctl` will incorporate data relative to that particular drive model in the tool database, so I could more accurately identify possible issues.

# Test Your SSD in Linux with Smartctl

Until now we have examined the data collected by the drive during its normal operations. However, the S.M.A.R.T. protocol also supports several “self-tests” commands to launch diagnosis on demand.

Unless explicitly requested, the self-tests can run during normal disk operations. Since both the test and the host I/O requests will compete for the drive, the disk performances will degrade during the test. The S.M.A.R.T. specification specifies several kinds of self-test. The most important are:

Short self-test (`-t short`)

This test will check for the electrical and mechanical performances as well as the read performances of the drive. The short self-test typically only requires few minutes to complete (2 to 10 usually).Extended self-test (`-t long`)

This test takes one or two orders of magnitude longer to complete. Usually, this is a more in-depth version of the short self-test. In addition, that test will scan the entire disk surface for data errors with no time limit. The test duration will be proportional to the disk size.Conveyance self-test (`-t conveyance`)

this test suite is designed as a relatively quick way to check for possible damage incurred during transporting of the device.

Here are examples taken from the same disks as above. I let you guess which is which:

```
sh$ sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdb

```

The test has now being stated. Let’s wait until completion to show the outcome:

```
sh$ sudo sh -c 'sleep 120 && smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdb'

```

Let’s do now the same test on my other disk:

```
sh$ sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdb

Once again, sleep for two minutes and display the test outcome:

```

Interestingly, in that case, it appears both the drive and the computer manufacturers seems to have performed some quick tests on the disk (at lifetime 0h and 12h). __I__ was definitely much less concerned with monitoring the drive health myself. So, since I am running some self-tests for that article, let’s start an __extended__ test to so how it goes:

```
sh$ sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdb
smartctl 6.6 2016-05-31 r4324 [x86_64-linux-4.9.0-6-amd64] (local build)

=== START OF OFFLINE IMMEDIATE AND SELF-TEST SECTION ===

Testing has begun.
Please wait 110 minutes for test to complete.
Test will complete after Tue Mar 13 00:09:08 2018

Use smartctl -X to abort test.
```

Apparently, this time we will have to wait much longer than for the short test. So let’s do it:

```
sh$ sudo bash -c 'sleep $((110*60)) && smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdb'

# 5  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         0         -
```

In that latter case, pay special attention to the different outcomes obtained with the short and extended tests, even if they were performed one right after the other. Well, maybe that disk is not that healthy after all! An important thing to notice is the test will stop after the first read error. So if you want an exhaustive diagnosis of all read errors, you will have to __continue__ the test after each error. I encourage you to take a look at the very well written smartctl(8) manual page for the more information about the options `-t select,N-max` and `-t select,cont` for that:

```
sh$ sudo smartctl -t select,810665230-max /dev/sdb

## Conclusion

Definitely, S.M.A.R.T. reporting is a technology you can add to your [tool chest to monitor your servers](https://linuxhandbook.com/server-monitoring-tools/) disk health. In that case, you should also take a look at the S.M.A.R.T. Disk Monitoring Daemon [smartd(8)](https://www.smartmontools.org/browser/trunk/smartmontools/smartd.8.in) that could help you automate monitoring through [syslog](https://linuxhandbook.com/syslog-guide/) reporting.

Given the statistical nature of failure prediction, I am a little bit less convinced however that aggressive S.M.A.R.T. monitoring is of great benefit on a personal computer. Finally, don’t forget whatever is its technology, a drive __will__ fail— and we have seen earlier, in one-third of the case, it will fail without prior notice. So nothing will replace [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) __and__ offline backups to ensure your data integrity!
