    ohmyzsh-full-autoupdate
)
```

> [!NOTE]
 > plugin config must before the `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`

#### Command-not-found

this plugin uses the command-not-found package for Zsh to provide suggested packages to be installed if a command cannot be found.

#### Extract

This plugin defines a function called `extract` that extracts the archive file you pass it, and it supports a wide variety of archive filetypes.

#### History-substring-search

The Plugin enables searching through commands history by typing a partial match of previous command.

Use ‚¨ÜÔ∏è or ‚¨áÔ∏è to match commands from history

#### Web-search

Open your browser with terminal search content

#### Z

> Zsh-z is a command-line tool that allows you to jump quickly to directories that you have visited frequently or recently.[\[3\]](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)

![[assets/Pasted image 20250105164146.png]]
1. `cd` needs the specific directory, _keywords_ of your directory which visited before is enough for `z`
2. `tab` with `z` show the scope that the _keywords_ would match.

#### Zsh-autosuggestions

It suggests commands based on your _history_ of previous commands and completions

#### Zsh-syntax-highlighting

Alert the wrong syntax with red color

#### Zsh-bat

This plugin will replace `cat` with `batcat`

```bash
sudo apt install bat
```

### VS Code Terminal Config

To config VS Code terminal, add the following properties to your user¬†`settings.json` to enable `Zsh`and `monospace` fonts.

> [!NOTE] A restart is required for font changes to take effect.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,
  "terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": true,
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell",
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "zsh"
}
```

## Shortcut

Use `Tab` to autocomplete file, directory, commands.

Erase the whole line via `Ctrl+U`.

`Home` or `End` (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+E`) can jump to the front or the end of the command.

`zsh-autosuggestions` with ‚û°Ô∏è gets the command from history, but sometimes the partial commands, words need to be modified to run,`Ctrl+U` remove the _word_ before the cursor.

`Ctrl+D` terminates the current SSH connection.

`history-substring-search` allows us to use `keyword` with ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, ‚¨áÔ∏è to filter commands from history.

`Ctrl+C` to kill the running program.`Ctrl+Z` to suspend it.

Use `Ctrl+Shift+C` and `Ctrl+Shift+V` to _copy_ and _paste_.
